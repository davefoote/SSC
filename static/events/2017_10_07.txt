**What is a Civic ScopeAthon?**
Our Civic ScopeAthon's main objective is to focus on a civic-minded or community-based problem, form cross-functional teams to scope out the problem, break the problem down into its parts and develop a plan to address the problem. The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented, or only parts of the solution may have a tech component.
